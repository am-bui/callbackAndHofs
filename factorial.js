// Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.

// EXAMPLE4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24, so calling factorial(4) should return 24.

// To get the factorial of a number you multiply that number by itself minus one until you reach the number one.

function factorial(num) {
  if (num < 0) {
    return 'Please input a positive integer';
  }
  if (num <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return num * factorial(num - 1);
}

// To check if you've completed the challenge, uncomment these console.logs!
console.log(factorial(5)); // -> 120
console.log(factorial(4)); // -> 24
console.log(factorial(6)); // -> 720
console.log(factorial(0)); // -> 1

        First Part of the recursion method
        You need to remember that you won’t have just one call, you’ll have several nested calls
        
        Each call: num === "?"        	         num * factorialize(num - 1)
        1st call – factorialize(5) will return    5  * factorialize(5 - 1) // factorialize(4)
        2nd call – factorialize(4) will return    4  * factorialize(4 - 1) // factorialize(3)
        3rd call – factorialize(3) will return    3  * factorialize(3 - 1) // factorialize(2)
        4th call – factorialize(2) will return    2  * factorialize(2 - 1) // factorialize(1)
        5th call – factorialize(1) will return    1  * factorialize(1 - 1) // factorialize(0)
        
        Second part of the recursion method
        The method hits the if condition, it returns 1 which num will multiply itself with
        The function will exit with the total value
        
        5th call will return (5 * (5 - 1))     // num = 5 * 4
        4th call will return (20 * (4 - 1))    // num = 20 * 3
        3rd call will return (60 * (3 - 1))    // num = 60 * 2
        2nd call will return (120 * (2 - 1))   // num = 120 * 1
        1st call will return (120)             // num = 120
        
        If we sum up all the calls in one line, we have
        (5 * (5 - 1) * (4 - 1) * (3 - 1) * (2 - 1)) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
